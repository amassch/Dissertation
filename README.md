All code was used as part of my bachelor thesis, including all modelling scripts and example frequency analysis code. 

Functions integrate_invert_EII, spm_gx_lfp and spm_fx_lfp were used to construct the DCM based EII model representing the circuitry dynamics during habituation. 

Examplary code for the frequency decomposition can be seen in the freq_decomp function.
